    ; The path can be defined as:
    ;
    ;     session.save_path = "N;/path"
    ;
    ; where N is an integer.  Instead of storing all the session files in

    ; a more efficient layout for servers that handle many sessions.
    ;
    ; NOTE 1: PHP will not create this directory structure automatically.
